# 3D-Printed Conduit Connector for Chemical Process Fluid Systems

##  Project Report: OVIYA P (212222210019)

[cite_start]This project explores the application of **Additive Manufacturing (AM)**, specifically **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)** [cite: 88, 107][cite_start], to design and evaluate a custom conduit connector for low-pressure fluid transfer systems in chemical process industries[cite: 6]. [cite_start]This addresses the challenge of acquiring customized or small-batch components where traditional methods are economically unviable[cite: 93, 94].

[cite_start]The resulting 3D-printed connector offers a rapid, cost-effective solution for producing custom process components, especially for educational and prototyping needs[cite: 46].

## [cite_start]Key Objectives [cite: 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]

1.  [cite_start]To design a 3D-printable conduit connector with industry-relevant geometry using **CAD tools**[cite: 99].
2.  [cite_start]To fabricate the connector using FDM with **PLA filament** and optimize printing parameters[cite: 100].
3.  [cite_start]To analyze mechanical and chemical performance through dimensional testing and flow experiments[cite: 101].
4.  [cite_start]To validate connector functionality through fluid dynamics calculations (e.g., head loss, Reynolds number)[cite: 102].
5.  [cite_start]To propose improvements for scaling the solution for various fluid types and system pressures[cite: 103].

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Materials

### Design and Modeling

* [cite_start]**Tool:** Autodesk Fusion 360 was used to model the conduit connector[cite: 41, 115].
* [cite_start]**Design Specifications:** The model featured a cylindrical body with a **10 mm internal diameter** [cite: 42, 115][cite_start], press-fit grooves for tubing insertion, reinforcement collars, and chamfers at inlets to reduce flow turbulence[cite: 42, 115].
* [cite_start]**Fabrication Method:** Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) was chosen for its accessibility and cost-effectiveness[cite: 41, 107].

### Material Selection: PLA

[cite_start]**Polylactic Acid (PLA)** was selected for this project due to its biodegradability, stiffness, dimensional accuracy, and low warping behavior during printing[cite: 116].

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Density** | [cite_start]$1.24 \text{ g/cm}^3$ [cite: 116] |
| **Tensile Strength** | [cite_start]$60 \text{ MPa}$ [cite: 116] |
| **Chemical Compatibility** | [cite_start]Suitable for Water, alcohol, saline[cite: 116]. |
| **Chemical Limitations** | [cite_start]Not suitable for acids, bases, or solvents[cite: 116]. |

### Slicing and Printing Parameters

[cite_start]The STL file was imported into Ultimaker Cura for slicing[cite: 117].

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layer Height** | [cite_start]$0.2 \text{ mm}$ [cite: 117] |
| **Wall Thickness** | [cite_start]$1.2 \text{ mm}$ (Three perimeters) [cite: 117, 165] |
| **Infill Pattern** | [cite_start]Grid ($25\%$) [cite: 117, 165] |
| **Nozzle Temperature** | [cite_start]$200 \text{ ¬∞C}$ [cite: 117] |
| **Bed Temperature** | [cite_start]$60 \text{ ¬∞C}$ [cite: 117] |

## üß™ Results and Validation

### 1. Dimensional Analysis

[cite_start]Most deviations were **< $\pm 2 \%$**, which is well within the acceptable tolerance for lab-scale plastic components[cite: 128, 129].

| Parameter | CAD (mm) | Printed (mm) | % Error |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Internal bore diameter | [cite_start]$10.00$ [cite: 126] | [cite_start]$9.82$ [cite: 126] | [cite_start]$-1.8 \%$ [cite: 126] |
| Total length | [cite_start]$65.00$ [cite: 126] | [cite_start]$64.70$ [cite: 126] | [cite_start]$-0.46 \%$ [cite: 126] |

### 2. Hydraulic Performance

[cite_start]Testing in a $10 \text{ mm}$ ID PVC tubing circuit with water flow validated the design for practical use[cite: 131, 171].

* [cite_start]**Maximum Flow Tested:** $2.54 \text{ L/min}$ (Turbulent regime: $Re = 6053$)[cite: 132, 133].
* [cite_start]**Head Loss:** At a typical loop flowrate of $1.72 \text{ L/min}$ (required for a $1.2 \text{ kW}$ cooling duty) [cite: 154][cite_start], the added head loss was **$4.4 \text{ mm}$ of water**[cite: 172].
* [cite_start]**Pump Impact:** This minuscule head loss translates to a pressure drop of **$43 \text{ Pa}$** [cite: 155][cite_start], which is **negligible** ($< 0.002 \%$ of cooling-water pump rating)[cite: 152, 172].

### 3. Mechanical Integrity

* [cite_start]**Hoop Stress:** The calculated hoop stress was $0.6 \text{ MPa}$ for a worst-case design pressure of $0.3 \text{ MPa}$[cite: 135].
* [cite_start]**Safety Factor:** The estimated Safety Factor was **$> 50$** (relative to PLA ultimate tensile strength of $60 \text{ MPa}$)[cite: 135, 142].
* [cite_start]**Burst Test:** The connector successfully withstood a hydrostatic burst pressure of **$0.45 \text{ MPa}$**[cite: 136, 173].

### 4. Chemical Compatibility

| Medium | Observation | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Distilled water ($25 \text{ ¬∞C}$) | [cite_start]No change [cite: 138] | [cite_start]**Suitable** for neutral aqueous streams[cite: 139]. |
| $20 \%$ Ethanol | [cite_start]Slight surface whitening [cite: 138] | [cite_start]**Limited Suitability** for solvents[cite: 139]. |
| $2 \text{ M HCl}$ | [cite_start]Surface crazing after $3 \text{ h}$ [cite: 138] | [cite_start]**Not Suitable** for strong acids[cite: 45, 139]. |

## [cite_start]üöÄ Design Improvements and Scale-Up [cite: 168, 169]

To extend the utility of the connector for industrial or more demanding lab environments:

1.  [cite_start]**Material Shift:** Upgrade to **PETG** or **Polypropylene (PP)** for better chemical resistance and a higher glass transition temperature ($80 \text{ ¬∞C}$ for PETG)[cite: 45, 139, 169].
2.  [cite_start]**Pressure Rating:** Integrate a $1.5 \text{ mm}$ **O-Ring Groove** to embed an elastomer seal, potentially raising the pressure rating to $0.6 \text{ MPa}$[cite: 169].
3.  [cite_start]**Connectivity:** Implement **ISO 7/1 BSP threads** for compatibility with standard metal piping systems[cite: 168].
